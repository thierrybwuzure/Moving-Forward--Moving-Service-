# Moving Forward - Moving Service Website

## Project Overview

**Moving Forward** is my first project built with the Bootstrap library. This project represents a significant breakthrough in my web development journey, enabling me to build professional-quality web applications much faster than when coding CSS from scratch.

Currently, the project features a single landing page and is under construction. This is a learning journey, and I will continuously expanding the project as I grow my skills.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure and accessibility
- **CSS3**: Custom styling for unique design elements and refinements
- **Bootstrap 5**: The primary CSS framework handling the majority of styling through utility classes and pre-built components. Bootstrap classes form the backbone of the layout, responsive design, and component styling throughout the project

## Project Status

### Current State
- Single landing page with responsive design
- Bootstrap-powered layout and components
- Custom CSS for project-specific styling needs

### Upcoming Features & Development
- **Additional Pages**: More pages will be added as the project expands (services detail page, contact page, testimonials, etc.)
- **JavaScript Functionality**: As I deepen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, I will implement:
  - Dark mode toggle functionality
  - Dynamic interactive features
  - Enhanced user experience with animations and transitions
  - Form validation and interactivity

## Learning Goals

This project serves multiple purposes in my development career:

1. **Bootstrap Mastery**: Learning to leverage Bootstrap's powerful utility-first approach to CSS
2. **Responsive Design**: Building mobile-first, responsive layouts efficiently
3. **Framework vs. Customization Balance**: Finding the sweet spot between using Bootstrap's built-in components and adding custom CSS for unique design requirements
4. **JavaScript Foundations**: Gradually integrating JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior
5. **Professional Development**: Creating a portfolio project that demonstrates modern web development practices

## Project Mindset

Rather than building everything from scratch with custom CSS (time-intensive), or relying entirely on a framework (less customization), this project strikes a balance. The majority of styling comes from Bootstrap's comprehensive class library, which provides:

- Consistent grid system
- Pre-styled components (buttons, cards, navigation, etc.)
- Responsive utilities
- Color system and typography

Custom CSS is applied strategically where the design requires unique styling that goes beyond Bootstrap's standard offerings.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the landing page
2. The site is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes
3. Visit the [Moving Forward](https://thierrybwuzure.github.io/Moving-Forward--Moving-Service-/) website

## Future Development

As this project evolves, expect to see:
- New pages and sections
- Interactive JavaScript features
- Improved accessibility features
- Optimized performance
